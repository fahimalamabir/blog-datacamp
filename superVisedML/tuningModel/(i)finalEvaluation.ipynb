    "# Hold out set reasoning\n",
    "I may want to report how well my model can be expected to perform on a dataset that it has never seen before, given my scoring function of choice. So, I want to use my model to predict on some labeled data, compare my prediction to the actual labels, and compute the scoring function. However, if I have used all of my data for cross-validation, estimating my model performance on any of it may not provide an accurate picture of how it will perform on unseen data. For this reason, it is important to split all of my data at the very beginning into a training set and hold-out set, then perform cross-validation on the training set to tune my model's hyperparameters. After this, I can select the best hyperparameters and use the hold-out set, which has not been used at all, to test how well the model can be expected to perform on a dataset that it has never seen before."
